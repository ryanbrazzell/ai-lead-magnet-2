    data entry

    no ownership

Section 2: Why They Buy NOW

Understanding what triggers action is critical for ad targeting and
messaging timing. These are the moments when prospects move from
\"someday\" to \"today.\"

Trigger #1: The Dan Martell Effect

A massive portion of leads come from Buy Back Your Time or Elite Group.
They\'ve been pre-sold on the concept.

> *\"I listened to his book probably about five or six times and decided
> I was kind of at a low point.\"*
>
> *\"I jump on an elite call with Dan and Dan goes, you got to get one.
> So that kind of keeps pushing me.\"*
>
> *\"I always remember Dan Martell saying, the first hire should be an
> EA.\"*

Trigger #2: Life Events

New baby, marriage, move, or health scare forces reprioritization.

> *\"Recently, we had a baby last year. That\'s a big one\...
> inevitably, my time decreased.\"*
>
> *\"We just moved with three children under five and I bought a
> business.\"*
>
> *\"As soon as my wife got pregnant, that\'s when I\'m like, okay, I
> gotta hire more people.\"*

Trigger #3: Hitting the Pain Line

Growth breaks their operations. They physically cannot scale further.

> *\"I hit that pain line\... growth hasn\'t really been an issue\...
> but I hit that line.\"*
>
> *\"I\'m at max. Like, yeah, I can\'t do anymore.\"*
>
> *\"There\'s no way I\'m going to scale at all without something like
> this\... it\'s just going to be a shit show if I try to.\"*

Trigger #4: Recent Assistant Failure

Their last VA/EA quit, failed, or got promoted out --- leaving an admin
vacuum.

> *\"I have been without a VA for, like, less than a week. And it\'s
> been\... I mean, he was awful.\"*
>
> *\"That person quit after a week\... she kind of just sent me an email
> and was just like, hey, I don\'t want to do it.\"*

Section 3: Pain Points

These are the problems prospects explicitly describe. Use these for
problem-agitation copy, ad hooks, and landing page above-the-fold
messaging.

Active Pain: Time & Capacity

> *\"I am so overwhelmed by administrative tasks\... I work 80 hours a
> week and I will say that probably half of that is admin stuff.\"*
>
> *\"I was building PowerPoints last night until 1:30 in the morning.
> Like I\'m not efficient at it.\"*
>
> *\"I\'ve been up till 5:00 in the morning for the, you know, 15th time
> that month.\"*
>
> *\"Not having enough hours in the day to get to the work that I need
> to get to.\"*

Active Pain: Cognitive Overload

> *\"I was driving around today, it\'s all in my head right now. I
> don\'t have a to-do list.\"*
>
> *\"I have open loops in my head, like, hey, what happened with this?
> Is this done now?\"*
>
> *\"My brain is like in overload.\"*
>
> *\"I can\'t turn my brain off at all.\"*

Active Pain: Email & Calendar Chaos

> *\"I have like, I don\'t even know 7,000 unread emails.\"*
>
> *\"Buried underneath my almost like 600 emails.\"*
>
> *\"I live in my inbox.\"*
>
> *\"The calendar is my biggest vulnerability. I double book.\"*

Active Pain: Failed Assistants

> *\"They just dumped someone on my desk.\"*
>
> *\"They\'re really more of doers\... whereas I need someone with a
> higher level.\"*
>
> *\"They\'re very reactive and they\'re very task driven. I always tell
> my VAs that and they just don\'t really get it, man.\"*
>
> *\"I couldn\'t give them an outcome or a goal and say figure it out
> and go do it.\"*

Active Pain: Personal Life Cost

> *\"I\'m trying to spend quality time with my daughter, but I\'m not
> actually, because my brain is constantly thinking about things.\"*
>
> *\"My wife wants me to have more time with our family.\"*
>
> *\"If it gets me back to the gym every day, that would be a win right
> there.\"*
>
> *\"I don\'t even work out right now\... my workout consists of a 45
> minute walk around the freaking park, which I hate.\"*

Latent Pain: Problems They Don\'t Recognize

These are problems they reveal but don\'t articulate as pain. Powerful
for educational content and \"aha moment\" copy.

Living in Inbox = Being Effective

> *\"I live in my inbox, so nothing\'s really getting past me.\"*
>
> --- Presented as positive --- actually a paradigm problem

Doing Low-Value Tasks

> *\"I went to Home Depot to get some stuff\... I don\'t need to be in
> Home Depot picking out screws.\"*
>
> *\"God, what am I booking? Why am I booking airline tickets here?
> Like, I don\'t need to do this.\"*

Overpaying for Misaligned Help

> *\"I have an expensive, overqualified health coach who\'s doing a lot
> of my phone triage\... she\'s an absolutely terrible salesperson.\"*

Key Person Risk

> *\"I am the one that needs to sell that job and create that quote\...
> It\'s all in my head.\"*

Section 4: Desired Outcomes

What does \"success\" look like to them? Use these for benefit-focused
copy, aspirational headlines, and transformation messaging.

Time Freedom

> *\"I\'m looking to take a month to six weeks off with my wife in the
> spring\... totally unplugging from the practice.\"*
>
> *\"My end goal is to end up working\... hopefully like three days a
> week by the end of the year.\"*
>
> *\"I want to get back to working two days a week.\"*

Zone of Genius Focus

> *\"Just to maximize my area of genius, my unique ability. It\'s not in
> my inbox.\"*
>
> *\"I want to spend my time in front of clients, helping them grow
> their businesses.\"*
>
> *\"I just want to be the talent, the rock star, just show and get on
> stage and play. Not set up the stage.\"*
>
> *\"Get me out of PowerPoint.\"*

Business Scale

> *\"If I had time and I could just focus on that 100%, I would scale
> the hell out of this thing.\"*
>
> *\"We get close to exitable territory for our whole show.\"*

Systems & Structure

> *\"I need and benefit from structure.\"*
>
> *\"I want to come to my conference instead of run my conference.\"*
>
> *\"I want to build the company to a place where I can be anywhere and
> I don\'t have to be in Saskatoon.\"*

Personal Life Restoration

> *\"More time off, but more efficient time when I\'m working.\"*
>
> *\"My wife loves traveling, so. Yeah.\"*
>
> *\"There\'s definitely things also in our personal lives that we\'re
> just not getting to.\"*

-   *\"It\'s exactly what I\'ve been needing for, you know, 14 years.\"*

Section 6: Objections & Resolutions

Every objection that came up in sales calls, with the resolution that
worked. Use for FAQ pages, sales pages, and objection-handling copy.

  ------------------------------ ----------------------------------------
  **Objection**                  **Resolution That Worked**

  \"My work is too               80% is actually process-driven or
  complex/unique to document\"   information transfer tasks. You don\'t
                                 need to document --- Loom one time, EA
                                 builds the SOP.

  \"The training time --- I      Assistant Launch handles training via
  could just do it myself\"      4-week accelerator. You invest time
                                 once, get it back 10x.

  \"Trust/security concerns with Multi-layered process: background
  virtual/overseas\"             checks, NDAs, rolling trust (read-only
                                 access first). Systems eliminate 90% of
                                 trust issues.

  \"I don\'t think I have enough If you aren\'t busy enough, you need an
  work for full-time\"           EA to free you up to GET busy. Admin
                                 grows with the business.

  \"Cost/ROI concerns\"          It\'s a startup cost that pays for
                                 itself by preventing missed
                                 opportunities. \"It should pay for
                                 itself.\"

  \"I need someone local\"       99% of tasks can be remote. Local hires
                                 are 3-4x cost and often less
                                 service-oriented.

  \"I need to build SOPs first\" The EA builds the SOPs by watching you
                                 do it once (Loom video). They document
                                 for you.

  \"Spouse/partner concerns      Acknowledge directly. Can match with
  about female assistant\"       male EA if needed. Virtual nature
                                 actually helps.

  \"Industry-specific concerns   Confirmation of experience in regulated
  (HIPAA/FINRA)\"                industries. Proper training and
                                 compliance.
  ------------------------------ ----------------------------------------

Section 7: Competitor Positioning

What prospects said about alternatives they tried. Use for \"Why Us\"
copy and comparison content.

Magic

**Position: \"The puppy mill of the VA/EA world\"**

> *\"I couldn\'t give them an outcome or a goal and say figure it out
> and go do it. I had to very much systemize, write down a process, do a
> loom video, explain everything and then even then the quality wasn\'t
> that good.\"*

Stat to use: Magic has 45-52% weekly churn rate vs. Assistant Launch\'s
2.5%

Wing

**Position: \"Dumped on your desk\"**

> *\"Basically they matched me with someone and they like dumped that
> person on my desk. And then I was like, okay, awesome\... you just
> left them there.\"*

Athena

**Position: \"Complex process that creates dependency\"**

> *\"They take green, new talent and then they spend 30 days or more,
> sometimes cutting corners\... they install a pretty complex
> infrastructure that kind of makes you reliant upon them.\"*

Also: Requires extensive Loom videos upfront --- \"I can\'t record a
loom video to try to describe what I do\"

MyOutDesk

> *\"One of the things that was harder with them\... day one, you want a
> 12 month agreement and I\'m like, I don\'t know if I can trust this
> for 12 months.\"*

Fiverr/Upwork

> *\"I went to Fiverr\... Found a girl\... I told her, like, I didn\'t
> want her to answer phones on her cell phone\... It just wasn\'t a very
> good service.\"*

Common theme: No systems, no accountability, no support structure

Section 8: What Closes Deals

The specific moments, phrases, and proof points that pushed buyers to
yes. These are your highest-leverage copy elements.

Key Differentiators That Resonate

1\. Ryan\'s \"No Email App\" Story

Consistently gets \"wow\" reactions. Demonstrates the outcome is real.

> *\"I haven\'t had the email app on my phone for three years and we run
> a 4 to 5 million dollar a year business.\"*

*Prospect reaction: \"Wow\" / \"That\'d be next level not to ever have
email on my phone\"*

2\. The 2.5% Churn Rate

Hard proof of quality. Compare to Magic\'s 45-52% churn. Makes the case
for premium pricing.

3\. No Contracts / No Lock-In

Reduces risk perception dramatically.

> *\"I like the no commitment thing. I mean, I certainly will give it,
> commit to it for a while.\"*

4\. The Three-Pronged Approach

Right Person + Right Systems + Right Support. Differentiates from \"just
getting a person.\"

5\. The 4-Week Accelerator

Structured onboarding addresses \"training burden\" objection.

> *\"Knowing that your team is just there the whole time, that\'s part
> of the package --- that\'s huge.\"*

6\. Speed to Placement (3-7 Days)

Overwhelmed people want relief NOW, not in 6 weeks.

7\. Daily 15-Minute Meeting Structure

Concrete, visualizable system. Shows exactly how it works.

8\. \"We Don\'t Let People Fail\"

Ongoing support message that reduces risk perception.

> *\"We monitor every client every day.\"*

Section 9: Misconceptions to Address

False beliefs prospects bring to the call. Use for educational content,
myth-busting ads, and FAQ copy.

  ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------
  **Misconception**                   **The Truth**

  \"It\'s faster to do it myself\"    Short-term true, long-term
                                      disaster. You invest time once, get
                                      it back 10x.

  \"I need someone local\"            99% of tasks are remote-friendly.
                                      Local = 3-4x cost, often less
                                      service-oriented.

  \"My business is too unique/complex 80% is process-driven. EA watches
  to document\"                       once, builds the SOP for you.

  \"I need a clone of myself\"        You need someone who loves what you
                                      hate. Complement, don\'t duplicate.

  \"I need a Chief of Staff / PM      Clear the noise with an EA first.
  first\"                             Then you can think clearly about
                                      strategic hires.

  \"I need to build SOPs before       The EA builds the SOPs by watching
  hiring\"                            you. They document, not you.

  \"Living in my inbox means nothing  It means everything needs you.
  gets past me\"                      That\'s the problem, not the
                                      solution.

  \"VAs and EAs are the same thing\"  VA = reactive task doer. EA =
                                      proactive owner. Key difference is
                                      ownership.
  ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------

Section 10: Lost Deal Patterns

Why deals didn\'t close. Use for qualifying copy (attract right people,
repel wrong ones) and disqualification messaging.

Pattern #1: Hyper-Analytical / Unreasonable Expectations

Prospects who want to speak to clients with 1-2 years retention before
signing, ask endless questions without committing, or have expectations
that can\'t be met.

Pattern #2: Budget Mismatch

Looking for \$15-20/hour, 10 hours/week. Not a fit for the premium
model. Better to repel early with clear pricing than waste calls.

Pattern #3: Lack of Readiness

Can\'t let go of control (especially email). Wants to \"circle back in
the new year.\" Not actually ready to delegate.

Pattern #4: Misalignment of Needs

Insists tasks are too complex for anyone but a senior PM or Chief of
Staff. Rejects the EA model entirely.
