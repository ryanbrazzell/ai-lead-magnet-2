# 2. CURRENT SITUATION (Before Signing)

## What They Were Doing for Support

### DIY / No Support

- **Eli Allison**: Working 80 hours/week, half is admin
- **Kip Lynch**: "It's all in my head right now. I don't have a to-do list"

### Failed VA/EA Attempts

- **Dr. Erica Oberg**: "I have an expensive, overqualified health coach who's doing a lot of my phone triage... she's an absolutely terrible salesperson"
- **Vic Partha**: Two VAs but "quite a bit of hand holding... they're very reactive"

## What Was Broken

### **COMMON THEME: VAs are reactive, not proactive** (5+ calls)
- **Vic Partha**: "I always tell my VAs that and they just don't really get it, man. Like they're very reactive and very task driven"
- **Stacey Kauffman**: "They're really more of doers... whereas I need someone with a higher level"
- **Niko Kourouglos**: "You need that assistant to hire the assistant and train the assistant"

### **COMMON THEME: No systems/infrastructure** (5+ calls)
- **Kip Lynch**: "Everything's patched together with band aids"
- **Dr. Greg Eckel**: "Or lack of system. I totally know"
- **Vic Partha**: "We do have systems... but the number one thing for me that I need is I need more capacity"

### **COMMON THEME: Trust breakdown** (4+ calls)
- **Nat Bruno**: "I just didn't trust them enough to... for them to pull it off"
- **Dr. Greg Eckel**: "Communication, tracking projects"
- **Vic Partha**: "I don't trust my VAs with" certain tasks

# 3. TRIGGERING EVENTS

## Why NOW?

### Life Events
> **Nat Bruno**: "Recently, we had a baby last year. That's a big one... inevitably, my time decreased"

> **Whitney Harris**: "We just moved with three children under five and I bought a business"

> **Tyler Edwards**: "My wife wants me to have more time with our family"

### Business Growth/Overwhelm
> **Eli Allison**: "I am so overwhelmed by administrative tasks that I'm primarily doing... it's not sustainable. Like I work 80 hours a week"

> **Tyler Edwards**: "This year has really been, it's been picking up... that's a good thing, but also very challenging"

> **Eliana Berger**: "We just hit 10... we're starting to think about raising our next round"

### Recent Assistant Failure
> **Stacey Kauffman**: "I have been without a VA for, like, less than a week. And. But it's been. I mean, he was awful"

> **Alice Chin**: "That person quit after a week... she kind of just sent me an email and was just like, hey, I realized that you explained this job really clearly and really thoroughly, but I realized that I don't want to do it"

### Reaching Breaking Point
> **Jaret Thompson**: "The most pain I have right now, I think, is, like, it's just an overwhelmed thing. Right. You got way too much on the go"

> **Kip Lynch**: "There's no way I'm going to scale at all without something like this... it's just going to be a shit show if I try to"

---

# 4. PAIN POINTS (ACTIVE)
*Problems they explicitly described*

## Time/Capacity Pain

> **Alice Chin**: "Me working, you know, 80 to 100 hours a week and my team working all 35 hour weeks"

> **Eli Allison**: "I work 80 hours a week and I will say that probably half of that is admin stuff"

> **Stacey Kauffman**: "I was building PowerPoints last night until 1:30 in the morning. Like I'm not efficient at it"

> **Dr. Erica Oberg**: "If it gets me back to the gym every day, that would be a win right there"

> **Vic Partha**: "I can't max my throughput if I'm totally stuck in operations and being glued to our WhatsApp group chat, answering questions"

## Quality/Service Degradation

> **Vic Partha**: "Because I've scaled up and because, you know, I've tried to step away from operations... the quality has gone down as well. And so what's happened is our reviews have gone down"

> **Alice Chin**: "Hey, look, we're failing at this"

## Cognitive Overload

> **Kip Lynch**: "I was driving around today, it's all in my head right now"

> **Dr. Greg Eckel**: "I have open loops in my head, like, hey, what happened with this? Is this done now?"

> **Whitney Harris**: "My brain is like in overload in that like all of my system and processes that I even did have literally just been dashed"

## Training/Oversight Burden

> **Vic Partha**: "I feel like I have to be very available for my VAs"

> **Nat Bruno**: "I had to very much systemize, write down a process, do a loom video, explain everything and then even then the quality wasn't that good"

> **Dr. Greg Eckel**: "I'm following up with that. I have open loops in my head"

## Personal Life Sacrifice

> **Tyler Edwards**: "My wife wants me to have more time with our family"

> **Eliana Berger**: "Things kind of slip through the cracks. And there's definitely things also in our personal lives that we're just not getting to"

---

# 5. PAIN POINTS (LATENT)
*Problems mentioned but not articulated as pain*

## Living in Inbox (accepted as normal)
- **Eliana Berger**: "I live in my inbox, so nothing's really getting past me" â€” presented as positive but Ryan flags this as a paradigm issue

## Having to Oversee Project Management
- **Dr. Greg Eckel**: "I'm now on Asana, so I have full visibility of where things are" â€” Ryan flags: "That is an actual issue... you're having to provide oversight"

## Doing Low-Value Tasks
- **Kip Lynch**: "I don't need to be in Home Depot picking out screws"
- **Dr. Greg Eckel**: "God, what am I booking? Why am I booking airline tickets here? Like, I don't need to do this"

## Complexity Accepted as Unchangeable
- **Niko Kourouglos**: Multiple calendars across businesses, personal, kids sports â€” just describes complexity without recognizing it could be managed differently

## Energy Drain Not Recognized
- **Vic Partha**: "Being pulled into things that then drain your energy for the stuff that actually matters" â€” Ryan articulates this for him

---

# 6. DESIRED OUTCOMES

## Time Freedom

> **Eliana Berger**: "I would like to free up my time to focus on things that are higher leverage"

> **Dr. Greg Eckel**: "More time off, but more efficient time when I'm working"

> **Tyler Edwards**: "My wife loves traveling, so. Yeah" [wants to travel more]

## Business Growth/Scale

> **Dr. Greg Eckel**: "We get close to exitable territory for our whole show"

> **Kip Lynch**: "What I'd like to do is build and, or acquire... a profitable, cash flowing business"

> **Vic Partha**: "I know how to build my portfolio up. I mean, if I had time and I could just focus on that 100%, I would scale the hell out of this thing"

## Getting Out of Admin/Operations

> **Dr. Greg Eckel**: "Just to maximize my area of genius, my unique ability. It's not in my inbox"

> **Stacey Kauffman**: "I want to spend my time in front of clients, helping them grow their businesses... I want to get as much of the other stuff off my plate as I can"

> **Whitney Harris**: "I need to like, minimize how much time I'm doing some of the administrative work"

## Personal Life Improvements

> **Eliana Berger**: "There's definitely things also in our personal lives that we're just not getting to or if we're trying to do it just take up time, appointments, things that. Life things"

> **Tyler Edwards**: "More time with our family"

> **Dr. Greg Eckel**: "I'm looking to take a month to six weeks off with my wife in the spring and a month to six weeks off in the fall"

## Systems/Structure

> **Stacey Kauffman**: "I need and benefit from structure"

> **Eli Allison**: "It's exactly what I've been needing for, you know, 14 years"

---

# 7. OBJECTIONS & HESITATIONS (Overcome)

## Trust Concerns

> **Nat Bruno**: "I just didn't trust them enough to... for them to pull it off"
- **Resolution**: Ryan explains trust is built through systems: "Systems eliminate 90% of trust issues"

## Bad Past Experiences

> **Niko Kourouglos**: "I've hired the super expensive assistant. I've hired the young, new, inexpensive assistant and it's always just kind of falls flat on its face"
- **Resolution**: Different approach â€” right person + right systems + ongoing support

> **Dr. Greg Eckel**: "I've had three executive assistants since, and I just don't know how to utilize them very well"
- **Resolution**: Training and infrastructure provided, not just a person

## Financial Concerns

> **Eli Allison**: "For me it's just like you said, it's ROI and finding that money and making sure that's, you know, financially doable for the company"
- **Resolution**: "It should pay for itself"

> **Jaret Thompson**: "I got to make sure I can make the commitment. Like I told you, liquidity kind of thing right now is jamming me up a little bit"
- **Resolution**: ROI framing â€” "Everything that we do in business is about ROI"

## Skepticism About Services

> **Stacey Kauffman**: "The skepticism is like, in all the companies you've mentioned, obviously I'm very familiar with. And they all have kind of similar challenges"
- **Resolution**: Low churn rate proof (2.5% vs Magic's 45%)

## Overwhelm About Onboarding

> **Kip Lynch**: "You probably saw my face the first time you mentioned accelerator. Like, you know, all that. Like, part of it is just like the whole hurry, hurry"
- **Resolution**: Reassurance it's a process, support provided

# 8. COMPETITORS & ALTERNATIVES MENTIONED

## Companies Named

### Magic
> **Nat Bruno**: "I think it was a company called Magic"
> **Ryan**: "Magic is sort of the puppy mill of the VA/EA world... they have a 50%, I think it was like 52% weekly churn rate"

### Wing
> **Niko Kourouglos**: "I looked at Wing... they matched me with someone and they like dumped that person on my desk"

### Athena
> **Niko Kourouglos**: "I looked at Athena... I liked the Athena model where they're like, we're going to come in and we're going to basically audit what you're doing and then we're going to build this handbook"
> **Ryan**: "They take green, new, green talent and then they spend 30 days or more, sometimes cutting corners... they install a pretty complex infrastructure that kind of makes you reliant upon them"

### Also Mentioned
- Belay
- Zirtual

## Why Alternatives Failed

> **Niko Kourouglos** (on Wing): "Basically they matched me with someone and they like dumped that person on my desk. And then I was like, okay, awesome... you just left them there"

> **Nat Bruno** (on Magic): "All of them, they were all good people... I couldn't give them an outcome or a goal and say figure it out and go do it. I had to very much systemize, write down a process, do a loom video"

> **Stacey Kauffman** (on past VAs): "They're really more of doers. Right. Whereas I need someone with a higher level"

# 10. MISCONCEPTIONS & FALSE BELIEFS

## "I Need to Train Them on Everything"
> **Nat Bruno**: "I had to very much systemize, write down a process, do a loom video, explain everything"
- **Correction**: Assistant Launch provides trained EAs with existing systems

## "Living in Inbox = Being Effective"
> **Eliana Berger**: "I live in my inbox, so nothing's really getting past me"
- **Correction**: Ryan: "I haven't had the email app on my phone for three years and we run a 4 to 5 million dollar a year business"

## "I'm the Problem"
> **Dr. Greg Eckel**: "Maybe it's me. Maybe I'm not giving them all of the information or the system to run"
- **Correction**: Three-pronged approach needed: right person + right systems + right support

## "Complex Means I Need Complex Solutions"
> **Niko Kourouglos**: Describes elaborate multi-calendar setup as unchangeable

## "VAs and EAs Are the Same"
