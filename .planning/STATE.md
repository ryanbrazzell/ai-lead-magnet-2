# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-23)

**Core value:** The PDF must make the reader think "I clearly need an assistant and I clearly can't do this alone"
**Current focus:** Phase 3 — Core Four Task Pages + CTA

## Current Position

Phase: 3 of 5 (Core Four Task Pages + CTA)
Plan: 1 of 3 in current phase
Status: Executing
Last activity: 2026-02-25 — Completed 03-01-PLAN.md

Progress: [█████░░░░░] 50%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 5
- Average duration: 2.6min
- Total execution time: 0.22 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-cleanup-foundation | 2 | 7min | 3.5min |
| 02-cover-roi-framework | 2 | 4min | 2min |
| 03-task-pages-cta | 1 | 2min | 2min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 5min, 2min, 2min, 2min, 2min
- Trend: stable (fast)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 5-phase structure — cleanup/foundation before any page builders, static pages before dynamic, prompt change isolated from layout work
- [Roadmap]: Phase 3 includes both task pages AND CTA page — they form one coherent delivery boundary (the conversion mechanism)
- [Roadmap]: Phase 5 (design) comes last — pages must exist before adversarial design process can evaluate them
- [01-01]: Named color constant object `C` (not `COLORS`) for shorter spread syntax
- [01-01]: 16 RGB color constants including Core Four area accent placeholders
- [01-01]: Core Four accents need design confirmation before Phase 3
- [01-02]: safeBottomY default 270mm (not 282mm) -- leaves 27mm for footer area
- [01-02]: checkPageBreak is internal (not exported) -- layout implementation detail
- [01-02]: Added checkPageBreak to renderFounderTasksSection (deviation: found overflow-vulnerable loop during Step 5 sweep)
- [02-01]: company_name sourced from leadData.businessType (not a separate company field)
- [02-01]: revenue_range and ceo_hourly_rate sourced from ROI object -- no transformToPDFData signature change needed
- [02-01]: ROI pain text uses C.accent bold for visual emphasis before analysis block
- [02-02]: Core Four accent colors spread via mutable tuple copy to satisfy TypeScript readonly const constraints
- [02-02]: No checkPageBreak in buildFrameworkPage -- content must fit single page (FRAME-03)
- [02-02]: Page number comments simplified to "Page 3+" for task pages (dynamic content makes fixed numbers misleading)
- [03-01]: inferCoreTaskType placed after DATA TYPES section for clean type ordering
- [03-01]: renderCoreFourSection and buildCoreFourTaskPages internal (not exported) — called by generateTimeFreedomReport in Plan 03-03
- [03-01]: Accent color spread uses mutable tuple copy pattern consistent with Phase 2

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Token budget for richer descriptions (4096 tokens may be tight for 24+ tasks with 2-3 sentence descriptions) — must verify before Phase 4
- [Research]: Fallback content quality — static fallback task arrays need to be written with same care as framework copy
